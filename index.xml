      <description>I am a recreational supbar “Olympic” weightlifter. “Olympic” is in quotation because the athletes of this sport actually call it just weightlifting, yet it is more commonly known as Olympic weightlifting among other people.
Weightlifting consists of two main lifts: Snatch and Clean &amp;amp; Jerk. The snatch tests a lifter’s ability to lift the weight from ground to overhead in one continuous motion. In the clean and jerk, on the other hand, the lifter lifts the weight from ground to overhead in two motions: the clean, in which he brings the bar to the shoulders, the jerk, in which he raises the bar overhead.</description>
