      <description>Weightlifting I am a recreational supbar “Olympic” weightlifter. “Olympic” is in quotation because the athletes of this sport actually call it just weightlifting, yet it is more commonly known as Olympic weightlifting among other people.
Weightlifting consists of two main lifts: Snatch and Clean &amp;amp; Jerk. Both lifts test a lifter’s ability to lift the weight from ground to overhead. The snatch does it in one continuous motion, while the clean and jerk does it in two motions: the clean, in which the lifter brings the bar to the shoulders, the jerk, in which the lifter raises the bar overhead.</description>
