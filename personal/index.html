<h2 id="weightlifting">Weightlifting</h2>
<p>I am a recreational supbar “Olympic” weightlifter. “Olympic” is in quotation because the athletes of this sport actually call it just <em>weightlifting</em>, yet it is more commonly known as Olympic weightlifting among other people.</p>
<p>Weightlifting consists of two main lifts: Snatch and Clean &amp; Jerk. Both lifts test a lifter’s ability to lift the weight from ground to overhead. The snatch does it in one continuous motion, while the clean and jerk does it two motions: the clean, in which the lifter brings the bar to the shoulders, the jerk, in which the lifter raises the bar overhead.</p>
<p>Another possibly interesting feature of weightlifting is the use of the metric system rather than the imperial system. Lifters' bodyweights and weights loaded on the bar are expressed in kilograms.</p>
<p>My current personal records (PRs) for these two lifts are, Snatch 91kg/200lbs, and C&amp;J 109kg/240lbs.</p>
