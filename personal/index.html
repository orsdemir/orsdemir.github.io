<h2 id="weightlifting">Weightlifting</h2>
<p>I am a recreational subpar “Olympic” weightlifter. “Olympic” is in quotation because the athletes of this sport call it just <em>weightlifting</em>, yet it is more widely known as Olympic weightlifting among other people.</p>
<p>Weightlifting consists of two main lifts: Snatch and Clean &amp; Jerk. Both lifts test a lifter’s ability to lift the maximal weights from ground to overhead. The snatch does it in one continuous motion, while the clean and jerk does it in two motions: the clean, in which the lifter brings the bar to the shoulders, the jerk, in which the lifter raises the bar overhead. Both lifts are quite technical, and it would take a lifetime to refine one&rsquo;s technique. This is the beauty of weightlifting; one can actually enjoy the process rather than focusing on the outcome.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, weightlifting is one of the <a href="https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/how-dangerous-are-weight-lifting-and-olympic-lifting-really" target="_blank">safest sports</a>&mdash; as long as it is done properly. I have been doing this for a while now (over 5 years), and I have never had a major injury. This does not mean that there is no risk. There is always a risk, but to me risk-benefit trade-off favors weightlifting. As we age, we lose muscle. The only way to slow or even reverse it, to some extent, is to lift weights.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of weightlifting is the use of the metric system rather than the imperial system. Lifters' bodyweights and weights loaded on the bar are expressed in kilograms.</p>
<p>My current personal records (PRs) for the two lifts are, Snatch 91kg/200lbs, and C&amp;J 109kg/240lbs.</p>
<!-- I keep my training log on my 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adem111.lifting/) page. The videos show how my technique improves over time, and as a result I can lift heavier weights. -->
