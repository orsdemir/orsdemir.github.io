<p>I am a recreational supbar &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo; weightlifter. &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo; is in quotation because we actually call it just &ldquo;weightlifting&rdquo;, although it is better known as Olympic weightlifting among people.</p>
<p>Weightlifting consists of two main lifts:  Snatch and Clean &amp; Jerk. The snatch tests a lifter&rsquo;s ability to lift the weight from ground to overhead in one continuous motion. In the clean and jerk, on the other hand, the lifter lifts the weight from ground to overhead in two motions: the clean, in which he brings the bar to the shoulders, the jerk, in which he raises the bar overhead. In weightlifting, the metric is system is used. Lifters' bodyweights and weights loaded on the bar are expressed in kilograms.</p>
<p>My current personal records (PRs) for these two lifts are, Snatch 91kg/200lbs, and C&amp;J 109kg/240lbs.</p>
